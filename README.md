# C-Cryptographylib
all of my code is in each challenge, so my functions header file will change 
in each folder, adding apon the last folder.
Things that dont work right now:
BreakSingleByteXor Likes to return strings that are above 128 therefore you wont see output
either that or i didnt convert the inputs correctly and its all broken
